<h2>YouTube Video Combined Uploader Project</h2>
This project was to use the YouTube API to create a video uploading tool that would allow you to combine multiple videos into one. The original motive behind the development was to create videos that featured their own URL using this technique, however it has been expanded for more general use.<br>
With this, you can combine two videos binary-wise mid-upload and create interesting effects, most notably the original reason this was made was to allow for your video to contain its own url.<br>
No private data is collected by this application, certain private data is accessed by the application to facilitate the uploading of videos, however any data accessed is not stored remotely and is only accessible to you. The privacy disclaimer as required by YouTube is available <a href="PRIVACY_DISCLAIMER.txt">here</a>.<br>
Due to the design of the code, the full code may only be released to private, trusted, individuals. However, a public version of the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/RandomGamer123/youtube_url_in_video">Github</a> or in a zip file <a href="public_sample.zip">here</a>.

When you use this application for the first time, please run oauth.py to generate your authorisation.
You will need to only do this once unless the authorisation expires or you revoke the authorisation.
Then, run oauth_refresh.py to retrieve your access token.
Then, you can use upload.py to upload combined videos. 
In the case upload.py prompts you to run oauth_refresh.py again, do that.
